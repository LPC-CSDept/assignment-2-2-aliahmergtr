Programming Assignment 2-2
Github main.py file link: https://github.com/LPC-CSDept/assignment-2-2-aliahmergtr/blob/main/main.py 

Problem Definition
The problem solved by this program is that it can calculate and display a temperature in fahrenheit when given the input of a temperature in celsius, converting the celsius to fahrenheit.

Input and Output
input : any number intended to be a temperature in celsius
output : float with two decimal places for the fahrenheit value from celsius input

Variable Explanation
celcius: stores user input for celsius amount as a float.
fahrenheit: set equal to 1.8 * celcius + 32

Flow Chart


Errors and Lessons
My first error came from trying to multiply 9/5 to my celcius variable since the user input is defaulted to be a string, and you can’t multiply to a string. I fixed this by converting the standard input block to a float like this “celcius = float(input(...))”, enabling the program to correctly calculate the fahrenheit amount when given celsius.
My second and final mistake was forgetting to add two decimal places when printing the calculated fahrenheit value, easily fixed through adding “:.2f” to the end of my reference to the fahrenheit variable in the print statement.
Through this assignment, I’ve learned to calculate a fahrenheit amount given a celsius temperature in python.
